Telegram bot 
============
* Project for MIPT'17 database.
* This is the telegram-bot, imitating restaurant service, where user can look at menu, reserve a table, make an order.
* Telegram: [@therestaurantbot](https://telegram.me/therestaurantbot) (but it's unactive now because the bot isn't running on some server).
* However, you can test it on your machine (but remember that this version is kinda alpha-version, so bot suffers from bugs).
* It uses python3, and works with database via sqlite.
---
Bot parses the information from user and saves it to database. So all actions are provided with database queries.
