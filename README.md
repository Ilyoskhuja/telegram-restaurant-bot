Telegram bot 
============
* Project for MIPT'17 database.
* This is the telegram-bot, imitating restaurant service, where user can look at menu, reserve a table, do an order. It hosts by [cloud9](https://ide.c9.io/).
* Telegram: [@therestaurantbot](https://telegram.me/therestaurantbot) (but it's unactive know because cloud9 can't run my code all the time).
* It uses python3, and works with database via sqlite.
